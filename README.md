# ✨Self-Care Center✨

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
I built an app that generates random affirmations and mantras. Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth. Mantras are repetitive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices. People may feel at times that they need to hear something positive to boost their mood and ease their worries. Relaxing CSS animations were added to help enhance the calming feeling desired from the app with transitioning backgrounds, fade in text, and beauitufl CSS gradients.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I spent about 10 hours working on this project. Most of my time was spent working through CSS issues (~6.5 hours) because I chose to work on more intermediate CSS concepts. I am currently in Week 3 of Turing, Mod1.
